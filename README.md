Style Transfer using PyTorch

I am a hubble everything engineer that has managed to pick up a little bit of everything: mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, software, you name it. 

This is a bit of my humble coding focused on machine learning built, for now at least, in PyTorch. 

If you have an interest and some time, I would recommend Udacity classes on the subject.
