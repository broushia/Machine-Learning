Style Transfer using PyTorch

I am a humble everything engineer that has managed to pick up a random grab bag of skills: some mechanical, a little electrical, a bit of manufacturing, software, you name it. 

This is a bit of my coding focused on machine learning built, for now at least, in PyTorch. 

If you have an interest and some time, I would recommend Udacity classes on the subject.
